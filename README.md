# Colorado's Population Growth Quickly Outpacing Liveability
In this study, we take a look at Colorado's massive population increase over the last decade, and how that growth will impact Colorado's liveability over the next five years. Specifically, we are curious if the availability and price of apartments and houses will continue to rise to a point of unsustainability.

## Communication Strategy
The team will leverage Slack as a communication hub as well as Google Drive for any document submissions through Canvas. The team committed to meeting every Monday and Wednesday during class hours to discuss the tasks ahead, problem solve, and disseminate next steps. Additionally, the team has created a GitHub repository to hold all files, code, and data used for the project.

## Machine Learning Model Strategy
The team determined leveraging historical data to train our machine learning model is the best path forward. **This historical data from Colorado will include:** house and apartment availability and price, as well as population, median income, and other liveability measures. 
- Upon gathering the data, the decision was made to use a supervised machine learning model, apply a linear regression model, standardize the data, and hopefully leverage the model to predict future results.
