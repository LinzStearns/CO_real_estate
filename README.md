## Purpose of Project
Anyone who has grown up in or moved to Colorado in the last two decades has experienced the wave of people moving from all over the country to settle in the Centennial State. To this day the state continues to scramble to respond to the inevitable impacts of a rapidly growing population, which has seen an increase of 1.4 million people since 2000. As a result, one of the hardest hit industries is the real estate market. In this study, we take a look at Colorado's massive population increase over the last decade, and how that growth will impact Colorado's liveability over the next five years. Specifically, we are curious if the availability and price of apartments and houses will continue to rise to a point of unsustainability.

## Communication Strategy
The team will leverage Slack as a communication hub as well as Google Drive for any document submissions through Canvas. The team committed to meeting every Monday and Wednesday during class hours to discuss the tasks ahead, problem solve, and disseminate next steps. Additionally, the team has created a GitHub repository to hold all files, code, and data used for the project.

## Machine Learning Model Strategy
The team determined leveraging historical data to train our machine learning model is the best path forward. This historical data from Colorado will include house and apartment availability and price, as well as population, median income, and other liveability measures. Upon gathering the data, the decision was made to use a supervised machine learning model, apply a linear regression model, standardize the data, and hopefully leverage the model to predict future results.
